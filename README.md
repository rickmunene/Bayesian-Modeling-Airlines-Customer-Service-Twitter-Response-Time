# Bayesian Modeling Banks Customer Service Twitter Response Time
***Using Student’s t-distribution, Poisson distribution, Negative Binomial distribution, Hierarchical modeling and Regression***

Twitter is the first place people go for customer experience when interacting with service providers such as banks and telcos in Kenya. From a past study, Twitter found that customers were willing to pay more for a service provider that responded to their tweet in under six minutes.

Inspired by this finding, I couldn’t help but wanted to model and compare Kenyan banks customer service twitter response time especially in this Corvid-19 lockdown period.

- I wanted to be able to answer these questions by using Bayesian Modeling:
- Are there significant differences on customer service twitter response time among all the airlines in the data?
- Is the weekend affect response time?
- Do longer tweets take longer time to respond?
- Which airline has the shortest customer service twitter response time and vice versa?
